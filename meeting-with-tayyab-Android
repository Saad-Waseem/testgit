As we are assigned to meet with two team leads we have done it today.
our first Meeting was with Tayyab Khalid. He is team lead for android development. He discussed about two apps 
1- Nautic translate
2- toolbox
NAUTIC Translate:
	 is an android app. which can translate nautic terms into ten languages including german,Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Danish, 		 Portuguese, Dutch and Greek. it has ability to translate around 1.800 nautical terms of different categories. it also has
         the feature to find stores nearest to ones location when one is traveling on a ship. we can also use it to find directions and
         manage budget that is cost by a single journey alongwith share from different friends/partners.
Tools:
	Eclipse with yahoo-Apis to provide currency conversion
Difficult part:
     	First Requiremts are not clear evolving with the passage of time so it became difficult to keep all the things align.Accurate currency 		conversion that should be up-to-date so conversion of currency while maintaing a check on current rate is most 
	critical part of this application.
2-toolBox:
	This is an android app too. This project was given by a german company named "Bauhaus".the tool box will provide with the facilities 		to design your own room or home as you want. It provide different tools for this purpose which includes water level, flashlight, tape 		measure and Unit converter. the BAUHAUS Toolbox also offers many other useful services. you can watch video tutorials to see how can 		you fix a problem using different tools. Ans as I said toolbox can also be used to design your home with your own hands.
Tools:
	Eclipse
Difficult part:
	the most difficult part was scaling the scale upto the real standard of calibration which involves a lot of complex calculations 
	with high precision.Actually this scaling thing was used in room planner for example to place a window at the right place.
